This project explores advanced methods for comparing sentence similarity in medical texts using transformer models. By experimenting with various similarity metrics like cosine, Jaccard, Euclidean, Manhattan, and Pearson correlation, the project focuses on optimizing these methods through techniques like converting distance metrics into similarity scores. Utilizing the BIOSSES dataset, the project applies hyperparameter tuning to identify the most effective model and similarity function, ultimately selecting the "all-distilroberta-v1" model with cosine similarity as the best performer. The final function demonstrates improved accuracy in assessing semantic similarity within the biomedical domain.
